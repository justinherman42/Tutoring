## things to do for that project



### If you want to add armor, 
+ it wont be that difficult
+ where boss is dealing damage you would need to just create an if else block.
+ something like( I dont rememember exactly how we have it but) 
  
``` 
## if else block determines damage.  If shield is heavy, damage is divided by 5
  if backpack[2].startswith("L"):
    dam= random.rand(30,50)
  else:
    dam= random.rand(30,50)/ 5
```
